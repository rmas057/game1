V0.15:
  - perf: removed Send() runtime allocations from casting callback to uv_watcher_cb
  - perf: removed Receive() runtime allocations from casting callback to Action

V0.14:
  - fix: WriteRequest Pool logic moved out of WriteRequest. Simplifies code and
    fixes a bug where
      Shutdown->Pool.Clear->WriteRequest.Dispose->WriteRequest.Close
    would try to return to the pool that we are currently iterating (potential
    dead lock / race condition)
  - fix: [MonoPInvokeCallback] attribute added to C->C# callbacks to fix IL2CPP
    builds runtime error "NotSupportedException: To marshal a managed method,
    please add an attribute named 'MonoPInvokeCallback' to the method definition"
  - perf: ConcurrentPool converted to regular Pool. libuv uses an event loop,
    and the callbacks are always called in main thread
V0.13:
  - Windows 32 Bit support
V0.12:
  - fix: Windows DLL built in release mode to avoid missing dependencies causing
    DllNotFoundException in Unity
  - Server GetAddress implemented
V0.11:
  - fixes, perf, cleanup
  - libuv binaries bumped to V1.39.0
V0.10:
  - feature complete
